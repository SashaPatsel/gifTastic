# gifTastic

This app allows users to see gifs from their favorite TV shows stacked neatly against one another on a sleek background. 

You are given some of my favorite TV Shows to start with, but you can add your own shows using the search button. Once you've hit submit, you'll get your very own button to generate gifs from YOUR favorite shows. 

This app uses the gify API to call for 10 gifs from any given show (all though the search bar can return gifs of any sort, not just TV shows).
